Abstract
Background: The use of probiotics and prebiotics as adjuvants in the treatment of eating disorders, known as psychobiotics, has already been investigated as modulators of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the effects of probiotic supplementation on food addiction and binge eating in individuals after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgery had not yet been studied.

Methods: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 101 patients that received probiotic or placebo supplements for 90 days after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, starting on the 7 th Postoperative day. They were evaluated preoperatively (T0), at 90 days(T1) and 1 year(T2) after surgery. The Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) and Binge Eating Scale (BES) were applied to assess food addiction and binge eating, respectively.
